 In Intel, 86,64 assembly, the is going to be an address  

For a long time, I've been confused between the effective address and moving instructions   

I think what I've been imagining was that Lord Hyphen effective address was performing in some weird manner, but in fact it is performing the way you would expect it to. It's just that people are using it to do calculations 

The move instruction interpret the second argument, the bracket address as as an address and it references from that address and gets the value and stores that in the source upper end   

The Lord effective address instruction expects the second op to be an address. The brackets are notation and there are some convenience calculation syntax that can be used to multiply with the multiple of two and add and so valued determined. Essentially the value that inside the square brackets is stored in the source . 

If you choose to do this values that are not addresses and form of faster calculation   

So do something like ADI +4 into RX what you doing is calculating a value which is interpreted as an address and stored in the force of Rent   which is fine, not an address. It's a value and you've done a calculation anyway
