            <h3>Hello! I'm Bharat.</h3>
            <p>I'm a software engineer based in Bangalore, India.</p>
            <p>Most recently I worked at Atlassian.</p>
            <p>
                I was part of a team building a <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/engineering/handbook#Testing-recommendations">chaos engineering</a> framework, and then moved on to their  <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/migration">migrations</a> platform where I was maintaining a service critical to the company.
            </p>
            <p>I also worked with a team developing collaborative graph-based navigation for Confluence, for which my team got a <a  href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20220207086A1/">patent</a>.</p>
            <p>Prior to that, I built <a href="https://mothership.live/">Mothership</a>, an open source platform-as-a-service for deploying small applications.

            <p>
                <a href="https://mothership.live/">Mothership</a> is an open-source platform-as-service for small applications. Designed to be used for deploying internal-facing apps for companies, Mothership is easy to setup. Companies can have their own self-hosted PaaS with a simple <code>mothership-setup</code> command.
            </p>
           
            <p>Once set up, users can use mothership command-line interface to web interface to deploy their apps to the cloud without any need for knowledge of servers or containers.</p>
